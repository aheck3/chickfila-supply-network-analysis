# Chick-fil-A Supply: Network Theory & Distribution Center Analysis  
University of Notre Dame â€” MSBA Program  
**Course**: Network Theory & Analysis  
**Date**: April 29, 2025  

This project applies network theory to analyze the rapid expansion of **Chick-fil-A Supply**, a logistics-focused subsidiary of Chick-fil-A. Using clustering algorithms and centrality metrics, we evaluated whether the companyâ€™s distribution center (DC) placements align with store density and geographic efficiency. By modeling store relationships as a network, we uncovered structural patterns in Chick-fil-Aâ€™s supply chain and explored opportunities for strategic expansion. This analysis was completed as part of the **MSBA Network Theory & Analysis** course at the University of Notre Dame.

## Objective

1. Can clustering analysis explain where Chick-fil-A has placed their existing distribution centers?  
2. Where should Chick-fil-A strategically place new centers based on store geography?  

---

## Background

Chick-fil-A Supply launched in **2019** to vertically integrate and streamline the brandâ€™s growing logistics needs. The subsidiary currently operates **13 confirmed DCs** to support over **3,200+ store locations** nationwide.

## What is Chick-fil-A Supply?

Chick-fil-A Supply is a logistics-focused subsidiary launched in 2019 to streamline the brandâ€™s vertically integrated supply chain. The company operates distribution centers (DCs) that serve hundreds of restaurants across the United States. As of 2025, there are 13 confirmed DCs â€” 10 operational and 3 in development.

## Network Structure

- **Nodes**: All U.S. Chick-fil-A restaurant locations (scraped from Chick-fil-Aâ€™s website)  
- **Edges**: Pairwise geographic distances between stores (calculated using the `geosphere` package in R)

## Methodology

1. **Scraped Chick-fil-A store location data** using Python
2. **Calculated pairwise geographic distances** between stores using the `geosphere` package in R  
3. Removed duplicate vertices and cleaned store/location data  
4. Constructed an **undirected graph** where nodes are stores and edges are distances  
5. Applied the **Louvain clustering algorithm** to detect store communities  
6. Tested distance-based edge cutoffs (50kmâ€“500km) to find optimal cluster structure  
7. Calculated **closeness centrality** to assess how well-positioned each DC is within its community

### Clustering and Initial Cutoffs

We began by testing three logical distance thresholds â€” 200 km, 300 km, and 500 km â€” to define network boundaries and observe how store communities form under different assumptions.

To better understand what these distances look like geographically, we used **Google Earth** to visualize the radius around three operating distribution centers. This helped us confirm that our chosen cutoffs were reasonable based on regional store density.

- **200 km**: 30 communities â€“ Cartersville, GA  
- **300 km**: 15 communities â€“ Weston, FL  
- **500 km**: 7 communities â€“ Kansas City, MO  

These initial tests helped us understand how network density varies by region and informed our later decision to search for an optimal cutoff.

## Optimal Cutoff Selection

We ran Louvain clustering across cutoffs from 50â€“500 km to compare actual DC coverage to cluster size. The **75 km** cutoff yielded the lowest error and highest modularity (0.91), identifying 98 meaningful communities.

## Identifying Expansion Opportunities

Clusters showed **gaps** in the West Coast and Northeast regions. We recommend new DCs in high-density zones like **Los Angeles**, **Bay Area**, and **New York City**.

## DC Centrality Analysis

Using **closeness centrality**, we evaluated how centrally positioned each DC is within its local community. Several DCs ranked well, while others had room for optimization.

## Key Takeaways

- Distance-based clustering explains many current DC placements  
- High-density regions without nearby DCs signal strong opportunities for expansion  
- Simple network models can offer valuable insights for complex logistics systems
